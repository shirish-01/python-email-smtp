First, we import smtplib.
no need to download smtplib as it is inbuilt in python 3 AND 2.7
>>> import smtplib
Then, we set three strings- the sender’s and receiver’s email addresses and the sender’s password. Put your password for your mail ID in the string for a password.

>>> sender='thesender@gmail.com'
>>> receiver='receiver@gmail.com'
>>> password=’<enter your password here>'
Then, we create a server object using smptlib.SMTP(). We use the port 587 here, and the domain smtp.gmail.com.
note: for google the port number is 587 and for yahoo it is 465 . see it thoroughly in order to avoid errors

>>> smtpserver=smtplib.SMTP("smtp.gmail.com",587)


On this, we call the ehlo() method for Extended Hello. This lets the server identify the client, and also tells it that it must use the ESMTP (Extended SMTP) Protocol.

>>> smtpserver.ehlo()
Then, we call starttls() to use a transport layer security connection.

>>> smtpserver.starttls()
And then we call ehlo() again.

>>> smtpserver.ehlo
Then, we call the login() method on this server object. To this, we pass the parameters sender and password to let the client gain access from the Gmail server to send a mail.

>>> smtpserver.login(sender,password)
Then, we decide the message to send. To set the subject for the message, we do:


>>> msg='Subject:Demo\nThis is a demo'
Now, we call the method sendmail() to send the mail in Python. To this, we pass sender, receiver, and msg.

>>> smtpserver.sendmail(sender,receiver,msg)
Finally, we print a success receipt to the client and then exit.

>>> print('Sent')
>>> smtpserver.close() 
#do not forget to close the smtpserver at last.
Also, if you type in the incorrect password, you will come across this exception:
